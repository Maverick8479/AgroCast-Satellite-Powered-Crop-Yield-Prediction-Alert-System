# AgroCast-Satellite-Powered-Crop-Yield-Prediction-Alert-System
**AgroCast** is an end-to-end AI solution that forecasts crop yields at a district level using satellite vegetation data (NDVI), historical crop production, and climate data. It also flags potential low-yield zones by triggering early alerts based on statistical thresholds. Insights are presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard for actionable decision-making.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

### 1. NDVI Extraction
- Downloaded NDVI GeoTIFF using Google Earth Engine
- Used `rasterio` + `geopandas` to mask NDVI by district shapes
- Saved average NDVI per district to CSV

### 2. Merge Datasets
- Combined NDVI, crop yield, temperature, and production into one dataset
- Computed `Yield = Production / Area` if not present

### 3. Model Training
- Train an `XGBoostRegressor` to predict yield
- Evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² Score

### 4. Alert Generation
- Trigger alert if `Yield_Predicted < mean - 0.5 * std_dev`
- `Alert` column added to output CSV

### 5. Visualization
- Loaded final dataset into Power BI
  - KPI cards (Avg Yield, NDVI, Alerts)
  - Line chart (Yield over Years)
  - Filled map (District Alert Zones)
  - Data table with slicers (Crop, Year, District, Alert)
